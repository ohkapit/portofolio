                Hello, my name is Tajul Arifin Sirajudin. I am a Full Stack Web
                Developer, very interested in programming. I started programming
                since April, 2017. I have experience in creating several
                websites, such as monitoring, digital wallet, and online
                shopping. Worked with many libraries & frameworks like ReactJS,
                Codeigniter, Laravel, etc. It does feel amazing to see myself
                improving, Hoping to continue to improve and be better than now.
